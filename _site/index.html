        <p>I could be pensive, uhh... smart, supersticious, brave? And I, uhh, I can be light on my feet. If I drive for you, you get your money. I wrote you 365 letters. I relate to these characters because aspects of their personality are like me. If I drive for you, you give me a time and a place, I give you a five minute window. I could be whatever you want. Then, telling Derek Cianfrance that I'd ever I could rob a bank I'd do it on my motorcycle, and he said 'That's weird, I just wrote a script about that'. In most movies you spend so much time looking for any scraps of truth, and in this movie you're just marinating in it.</p>
