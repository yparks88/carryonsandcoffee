    <h2> About Carryons & Coffee </h2>
    <hr>
      <p>Whenever someone asks me where I'm from or where I grew up, it is a far from simple answer. Being Boston born  with schooling taking place over several states from preschool to college, moving and adaptation became a part of who I am. The short story is that I've earned my New Yorker card after 5 years of living in Harlem but recently switched it up to relocate to the Washington D.C. area. Throughout it all travel has become my teacher, my stress relief, and my joy. As the traveling only gets more adventurous, CarryOns & Coffee is my way of sharing what I see and learn throughout my journeys around the world.</p>

      <p>Until recently most of my travel has been around the United States with a memorable road trip to Montreal thrown in. Traveling with friends was another fun experience I was exposed to at a young age but I was fortunate to travel to my first country over seas because of work. That jump started the passport with a first stamp in England last summer in 2017. Since then, I have been to Australia, Mexico, Colombia, Bali, and more US cities, making it work any way that I can. In my blog, you will read about my methods including one way tickets, long weekends, new friendships, and shared goals. </p>

      <p>As you may have already guessed, I also love caffeine, specifically in coffee form. Does a day without an good cup of coffee even count as a day? Like James Bond, I have a recipe of choice. Two shots of espresso over ice, extra ice, extra splash of soy milk, swirled not shaken, topped with a dash of cinnamon. That is my bliss. Seasons, time of day, and availability force some variety in there but as I mentioned before, I can adapt. Years into the future I may want to lead a less caffeinated life but for now all of my travels, planning, and posting are comfortably accompanied by an iced coffee or three.</p>

    <h2> Where I've Been </h2>
    <hr>
      <p>As a child and teenager, I lived in Boston, New York City, New Jersey, Georgia, and North Carolina. As an adult I have lived in New York in the suburbs, New York City, and Virginia. Growing up in Boston, day trips to New York were frequent, usually with a friend brought along and chaperoned by mom. These trips were my preview into my future residency even though the streets we roamed were in the village more than in Harlem. Experiencing a city as a resident provides an entirely different view. I aspire to live in Sydney, Bali, and London before I settle down. California is also always in the back of my mind.</p>

      <p>Leisure travel has taken me to twenty one states: California, Conneticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania,Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia. I have been to 7 countries so far. All of these trips were a combination of family travel, trips with friends, and solo trips. Top five destinations to see next are Arizona (Grand Canyon), Costa Rica, Croatia, Thailand, and Texas(for the BBQ). </p>
