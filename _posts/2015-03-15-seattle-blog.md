post-intro: I was in love with Seattle before I ever even started planning a trip there. What could be better than rain and coffee shops guaranteed to have some plaid clad musician strumming away on a small stage? Even outside of the cafes, there would be trees and fresh air after the rain to enjoy on long walks in the woods. My vision had been shaped by a combination of books and music videos from my teenage years.

I was in love with Seattle before I ever even started planning a trip there. What could be better than rain and coffee shops guaranteed to have some plaid clad musician strumming away on a small stage? Even outside of the cafes, there would be trees and fresh air after the rain to enjoy on long walks in the woods. My vision had been shaped by a combination of books and music videos from my teenage years. I finally made it to Seattle during my first solo trip in April 2015 - a 10 day journey along the west coast featuring 3 cities and 2 countries. I would go straight to Seattle, spending one night in the quaint Panama Hotel, a site straight out of my newly read novel "Hotel at the Corner of Bitter and Sweet" by Jamie Ford. Then I would take the train to Vancouver to spend 4 nights on the West Coast of Canada, ready to compare it to an earlier stay in Montreal. After taking the train back to Seattle I would spend two nights downtown before boarding a flight to San Diego for a 3 day stay featuring my first surf lesson. I was also pleasantly surprised with my first complimentary upgrade at La Jolla Cove Suites.
