Wherever I travel, there are a few things that I must do. My latest one is get a massage, preferably on the beach. But my original favorite activities are try a local coffee, have a pina colada, go out for dinner at least once, and take pics of the hotel room before I bring my bags in.

Having an iced coffee as soon as I get off the plane is automatic.
