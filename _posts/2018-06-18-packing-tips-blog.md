Packing all of your travel items can cause a lot of stress but it doesn't have to be a dreadful experience. Here are five tips
that made fitting all of my items into my carryon bag a breeze for any trip.
1.) Roll up everything, do not fold clothes. Even with compression bags and other vacuum seal accessories available, this has

2.) Layers are so versatile and usually items being layered are not bulky. You can also mix and match layered items to vary your
outfits.
3.) Limit the amount of shoes that you bring.
