Packing all of your travel items can cause a lot of stress but it doesn't have to be a dreadful experience. Here are five tips that make fitting all of my items into my carryon bag and backpack a breeze for any trip.
1.) Roll up everything, do not fold clothes. Even with compression bags and other vacuum seal accessories available, this has
been the most effective space saver for me.
2.) Layers are so versatile and usually items being layered are not bulky. You can also mix and match layered items to vary your outfits.
3.) Limit the amount of shoes that you bring. I usually find that a pair of sneakers, a pair of heels, and a pair of flat sandals do the trick. I try to especially make sure that the sandals are comfortable for walking to ensure I'm not wearing the same pair of shoes in every picture.
4.) Depending on the time I land, I like to put the appropriate items in my back pack rather than my suitcase. This way i can still just drop it and go when I get to my location. If I land at night, I put my pjs in my bag and if I land somewhere during the day with a pool, my swimsuit is easy to grab.
5.) Following along with rule 4, I also always have my toiletries in my back pack or purse. This helps for a number of reasons but the primary one is that my own preferred products are just an arm's reach away.
