If you are a fan of lists and research, like myself, you will find planning for your trip almost as fun as going on it. Almost.

Before actually zipping up my suitcase one last time before heading to the airport, I tend to make at least two lists: a first draft and a final check off version. My first draft is a quick once over containing general articles of clothing, necessary toiletries, and miscellaneous accessories. It will often look like this:

To Pack:
-Tshirts
-Yoga pants
-Pjs
-Dresses
-Bikini
-Bras and things
-Socks
-Sneakers
-Sandals
-Sunglasses
-Phone charger
-Bodywash
-Lotion
-Deodorant
-Toothbrush & Toothpaste

When I start my final check off list to review before I hop in my uber or on the train, I get more specific. For example, I will list out which dresses, bikinis, and tshirts. This helps plan outfits effectively and limit the amount of packed items. The final packing list often looks like this:

To Pack:
-"Oh Hey Vacay" tshirt
-2 black tank tops
-olive green shorts
-black denim shorts
-yellow one piece swimsuit
-black bikini
-blue maxi dresses
-pjs
-2 sports bras
-3 pairs of socks
-black flat sandals
-black Nike sneakers
-beach towel
-phone charger
-contact lens solution

As you can see, its much longer and much more detailed but this prevents things from being forgotten. How many times have you reached your destination, unpacked at your hotel, and realized your party heels or favorite earrings weren't there? Sure you can manage but it's not ideal and all easily preventable.
